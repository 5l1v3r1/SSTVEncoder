SSTV Encoder
Copyright 2014 Olga Miller <olga.rgb@googlemail.com>

This application sends images via SSTV.
Images can be loaded from the "Share" option of any application (for example the image gallery).

After clicking on a mode the image will be scaled to that mode's native size.
To keep the aspect ratio, black borders will be added if necessary.
Original image can be resend using another mode without reloading.

Currently supported modes are:
    Martin Modes:
        Martin 1
        Martin 2
    Robot 36 Color
    Robot 72 Color
    Wrasse SC2-180

The mode specifications are taken from the "Dayton Paper" of JL Barber:

SSTV images can be decoded for example using this application:
